Explain the output of vmprint in terms of Fig 3-4 from the text. 
1.What does page 0 contain? 
    _init program code
2.What is in page 2?
    userstack which contains arguments of main function main(int argc, char**argv)
3.When running in user mode, could the process read/write the memory mapped by page 1?
    page 1 is an inaccessible page, PTE_U flag not set

4.Explain why the third test "srcva + len < srcva" is necessary in copyin_new(): 
give values for srcva and len for which the first two test fail(false)
(i.e., they will not cause to return -1) 
but for which the third one is true (resulting in returning -1).
    len may be large enough to cause unsigned overflow
