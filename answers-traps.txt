1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
    #a0 holds first argument, a1 second argument, e.g. argument 13 is the third argument placed in a2
2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
    #argument to function f is known at compiler time, compiler calculate that result 12; function f and g are not got called
3. At what address is the function printf located?
    #0x630
4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
    #0x38
